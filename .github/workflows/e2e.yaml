          # HACK(mrverdant13): E2E tests fail on Windows
          # This is due to a drive issue affecting the coverage gathering step.
          # The Dart SDK is installed in the C: drive, as well as the global packages.
          # The issue is that the coverage gathering step, on Windows, uses a relative path
          # that assumes the Dart SDK is installed in the same drive as the project.
